*Well, now I am. phew!* With this geeky commandline weekend project website ðŸ˜Ž 


It is a shamelessly discriminatory personal website that requires visitor to possess at least some very basic commandline interaction ability. 
However, this is arguably world's most universal and iconic UX of human-to-machine interaction, isn't it?    

It loads available commands as commandline apps from /apps dir. Apps use '.kajuapp' extension. Third party apps can also be installed.
